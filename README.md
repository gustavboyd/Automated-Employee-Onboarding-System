# Automated-Employee-Onboarding-System
This project implements an automated employee onboarding system using various Azure services. The system is designed to streamline the process of adding new hires by integrating Azure AD, Logic Apps, and other Azure resources. Below are the steps and services used to set up this system.

Azure Services Used
Azure AD: Manages user identities and access.
Azure Logic Apps: Automates workflows.
Azure Email Service (part of Logic Apps connector): Sends emails.
Azure Resource Manager: Manages Azure resources.

Steps to Set Up the System:

1. Azure AD Setup
1.1 Set up a new Azure AD instance (if not already present) using the Azure portal.
- Navigate to the Azure portal.
- Go to "Azure Active Directory".
- Create a new instance or use an existing one.

2. Logic App Workflow Design

2.1 Design a Logic App workflow triggered by an event indicating a new employee hire.
- Open the Azure portal.
- Navigate to "Logic Apps".
- Create a new Logic App.
- Define a trigger event (e.g., an entry in a SharePoint list or an email to a specific mailbox).

3. Azure AD User Creation

3.1 Use the Azure AD connector in Logic Apps to automatically create a new user in Azure AD based on the trigger event's details.
- In the Logic App Designer, add a step to create a user in Azure AD.
- Map the necessary details from the trigger event to the user creation fields.

4. Role and Group Assignment

4.1 Assign predefined roles and groups to the new user based on the job position or department indicated in the trigger.
- Add a step in the Logic App to assign roles and groups.
- Use conditionals to determine the appropriate roles and groups based on the trigger details.
  
6. Welcome Email

6.1 Leverage the Email connector in Logic Apps to send a welcome email to the new hire with instructions and necessary access details.
- Add a step in the Logic App to send an email.
- Customize the email content to include welcome messages, instructions, and access details.

7. Monitoring and Review

7.1 Monitor and review the onboarding process through Logic Apps run history and Azure AD logs.
- Regularly check the Logic Apps run history for any errors or issues.
- Review Azure AD logs to ensure all operations are completed successfully.

Conclusion

This automated employee onboarding system simplifies and accelerates the process of integrating new hires into the organization. By leveraging Azure services, the system ensures a consistent and efficient onboarding experience.
